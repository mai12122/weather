# 🌤️ WEATHER APP

## 📌 PROJECT TITLE

**WEATHER APP – REAL-TIME WEATHER FORECAST USING JAVASCRIPT**

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE

To design and build a responsive weather application using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** that fetches real-time weather data from an external API and displays key weather metrics such as:
- Current temperature
- Weather condition (e.g., cloudy, rainy)
- Feels like temperature
- Humidity
- Wind speed
- Forecast (optional)


## ⚙️ HOW IT WORKS

### 🔍 User Flow:
1. The user enters the name of a city in the input field.
2. On clicking the **Search** button:
   - A loading message ("Searching...") appears.
   - The app sends a request to the **OpenWeatherMap API** (or another weather API).
3. If the city is found:
   - The app displays:
     - City name
     - Temperature in °C
     - Weather icon
     - Condition (e.g., Clear, Cloudy)
     - Humidity
     - Wind speed
     - Feels like temperature
4. If the city is not found:
   - A "City not found!" message is shown.

### 🧠 Logic:
- The API response is parsed using JavaScript.
- DOM is updated dynamically without reloading the page.
- UI feedback is provided for loading and error states.
